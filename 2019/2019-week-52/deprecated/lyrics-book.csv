SAME OLD LANG SYNE,Dan Fogelberg,Same Old Lang Syne,32,But the traveling was hell,1980.948087431694
SAME OLD LANG SYNE,Dan Fogelberg,Same Old Lang Syne,33,We drank a toast to innocence,1980.948087431694
SAME OLD LANG SYNE,Dan Fogelberg,Same Old Lang Syne,34,We drank a toast to now,1980.948087431694

SAME OLD LANG SYNE,Dan Fogelberg,Same Old Lang Syne,38,We drank a toast to time,1980.948087431694
SAME OLD LANG SYNE,Dan Fogelberg,Same Old Lang Syne,39,Reliving in our eloquence,1980.948087431694
SAME OLD LANG SYNE,Dan Fogelberg,Same Old Lang Syne,40,Another 'auld lang syne',1980.948087431694
SAME OLD LANG SYNE,Dan Fogelberg,Same Old Lang Syne,41,The beer was empty and our tongues were tired,1980.948087431694
SAME OLD LANG SYNE,Dan Fogelberg,Same Old Lang Syne,42,And running out of things to say,1980.948087431694
SAME OLD LANG SYNE,Dan Fogelberg,Same Old Lang Syne,43,She gave a kiss to me as I got out,1980.948087431694
SAME OLD LANG SYNE,Dan Fogelberg,Same Old Lang Syne,44,And I watched her drive away,1980.948087431694
SAME OLD LANG SYNE,Dan Fogelberg,Same Old Lang Syne,45,Just for a moment I was back at school,1980.948087431694
